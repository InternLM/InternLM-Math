# Introduction
- **7B and 20B Chinese and English Math LMs with better than ChatGPT performances.** InternLM2-Math are continued pretrained from InternLM2-Base with ~100B high quality math-related tokens and SFT with ~2M bilingual math supervised data. We apply minhash and exact number match to decontaminate possible test set leakage. 
- **Add Lean as a support language for math problem solving and math theorem proving.** We are exploring combining Lean 3 with InternLM-Math for verifiable math reasoning. InternLM-Math can generate Lean codes for simple math reasoning tasks like GSM8K or provide possible proof tactics based on Lean states.
- **Also can be viewed as a reward model, which supports the Outcome/Process/Lean Reward Model.** We supervise InternLM2-Math with various types of reward modeling data, to make InternLM2-Math can also verify chain-of-thought processes. We also add the ability to convert a chain-of-thought process into Lean 3 code.
- **A Math LM Augment Helper** and **Code Intepreter**. InternLM2-Math can help augment math reasoning problems and solve them using the code interpreter which makes you generate synthesis data quicker!

# Performance
All performance is based on greedy decoding with COT. We notice that the performance of Hungary has a big variance between our different checkpoints, while other performance is very stable. This may be due to the problem amount about Hungary.

# Inference
We suggest using [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/LMDeploy)(>=0.2.1) for inference.
```python
from lmdeploy import pipeline, TurbomindEngineConfig, ChatTemplateConfig

backend_config = TurbomindEngineConfig(model_name='internlm2-chat-7b', tp=1, cache_max_entry_count=0.3)
chat_template = ChatTemplateConfig(model_name='internlm2-chat-7b', 
                                system='', 
                                eosys='', 
                                meta_instruction='', 
                                user='<|im_start|>user\n', 
                                assistant='<|im_start|>assistant\n', 
                                eoh='<|im_end|>\n', 
                                eoa='<|im_end|>\n',
                                stop_words=['<|im_end|>', '<|action_end|>'])
pipe = pipeline(model_path='internlm/internlm2-math-7b',
                chat_template_config=chat_template,
                backend_config=backend_config)

problem = '1+1='
result = pipe([problem], request_output_len=1024, top_k=1)
```

# Known issues
Our model is still under development and will be upgraded. There are some possible issues of InternLM-Math.
- Jump the calculating step.
- Perform badly at Chinese fill-in-the-bank problems and English choice problems due to SFT data composition.
- The reward model mode can be better leveraged with assigned token probabilities.
- Code switch due to SFT data composition.
- Some abilities of Lean can only be adapted to GSM8K-like problems (e.g. Convert chain-of-thought to Lean 3), and performance related to Lean is not guaranteed.
