# Introduction
- **7B and 20B Chinese and English Math LMs with better than ChatGPT performances.** InternLM2-Math are continued pretrained from InternLM2-Base with ~100B high quality math-related tokens and SFT with ~2M bilingual math supervised data. We apply minhash and exact number match to decontaminate possible test set leakage. 
- **Add Lean as a support language for math problem solving and math theorem proving.** We are exploring combining Lean 3 with InternLM-Math for verifiable math reasoning. InternLM-Math can generate Lean codes for simple math reasoning tasks like GSM8K or provide possible proof tactics based on Lean states.
- **Also can be viewed as a reward model, which supports the Outcome/Process/Lean Reward Model.** We supervise InternLM2-Math with various types of reward modeling data, to make InternLM2-Math can also verify chain-of-thought processes. We also add the ability to convert a chain-of-thought process into Lean 3 code.
- **A Math LM Augment Helper** and **Code Intepreter**. InternLM2-Math can help augment math reasoning problems and solve them using the code interpreter which makes you generate synthesis data quicker!

# Performance

## Pretrain Performance
We evaluate pretrain checkpoints based on greedy decoding with few-shot COT. Details of pretraining will be introduced in the tech report.
| Model                  |  GSM8K  | MATH   |
|------------------------|---------|--------|
| Llama2-7B |  11.8 | 3.2 |
| Llemma-7B |  36.4 | 18.0 |
| InternLM2-Base-7B |  36.5 | 8.6 |
| **InternLM2-Math-Base-7B** |  **49.2** | **21.5** |
| Minerva-8B |  16.2 | 14.1 |
| InternLM2-Base-20B |  54.6 | 13.7 |
| **InternLM2-Math-Base-20B** |  **63.7** | **27.3** |
| Llemma-34B |  51.5 | 25.0 |
| Minerva-62B |  52.4 | 27.6 |
| Minerva-540B |  58.8 | 33.6 |


## SFT Peformance
All performance is based on greedy decoding with COT. We notice that the performance of Hungary has a big variance between our different checkpoints, while other performance is very stable. This may be due to the problem amount about Hungary.

# Inference

## LMDeploy
We suggest using [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/LMDeploy)(>=0.2.1) for inference.
```python
from lmdeploy import pipeline, TurbomindEngineConfig, ChatTemplateConfig

backend_config = TurbomindEngineConfig(model_name='internlm2-chat-7b', tp=1, cache_max_entry_count=0.3)
chat_template = ChatTemplateConfig(model_name='internlm2-chat-7b', system='', eosys='', meta_instruction='')
pipe = pipeline(model_path='internlm/internlm2-math-7b', chat_template_config=chat_template, backend_config=backend_config)

problem = '1+1='
result = pipe([problem], request_output_len=1024, top_k=1)
```

## Huggingface
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("internlm/internlm2-math-7b", trust_remote_code=True)
# Set `torch_dtype=torch.float16` to load model in float16, otherwise it will be loaded as float32 and might cause OOM Error.
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("internlm/internlm2-math-7b", trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype=torch.float16).cuda()
model = model.eval()
response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "1+1=", history=[], meta_instruction="")
print(response)
```

# Known issues
Our model is still under development and will be upgraded. There are some possible issues of InternLM-Math. If you find performances of some abilities are not great, welcome to open an issue.
- Jump the calculating step.
- Perform badly at Chinese fill-in-the-bank problems and English choice problems due to SFT data composition.
- Tend to generate Code Interpreter when facing Chinese problems due to SFT data composition.
- The reward model mode can be better leveraged with assigned token probabilities.
- Code switch due to SFT data composition.
- Some abilities of Lean can only be adapted to GSM8K-like problems (e.g. Convert chain-of-thought to Lean 3), and performance related to Lean is not guaranteed.
